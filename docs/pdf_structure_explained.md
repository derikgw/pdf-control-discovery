This code uses the `PyPDF2` library (specifically `PdfReader` from the `pypdf` package) to **extract form fields** from a PDF file. To understand how this works, it helps to first understand how PDFs are structured, particularly the concept of **annotations** and **form fields** in a PDF.

### PDF Structure Overview

A PDF (Portable Document Format) file is a highly structured binary format that contains text, images, and other graphical elements organized in pages. Unlike other document formats, PDFs are designed for fixed layouts, which means their internal structure is complex, with different objects representing various elements (like fonts, images, and text).

In PDFs:
- **Pages**: Each PDF is made up of one or more **pages**. Each page contains visual content and other elements, like links, form fields, annotations, etc.
- **Annotations** (`/Annots`): Annotations are interactive elements in a PDF. They can represent things like hyperlinks, form fields, buttons, checkboxes, and comments. 
- **Form Fields**: These are interactive elements within a PDF that allow users to enter data (e.g., text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons).

### Key Concepts in the Code

- **/Annots**: This key in the PDF structure holds **annotations** for each page, which could include form fields. Each annotation contains various properties, such as the type of field (`/FT`), the field's name (`/T`), and its value (`/V`).
- **/T**: This key represents the **name of the form field**. It's essentially a human-readable name for the field that identifies it in the form.
- **/FT**: This represents the **field type**. Common values for `/FT` include:
  - `/Tx` for text fields.
  - `/Btn` for buttons or checkboxes.
  - `/Ch` for choice fields like drop-down menus.

### What the Code is Doing

The code is essentially a function to **discover form fields** in a given PDF by scanning its annotations. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. **`PdfReader(pdf_path)`**:
   - This initializes a **PDF reader object** from the given `pdf_path`. This object allows the function to read and access the pages and objects within the PDF.

2. **`for page in pdf_reader.pages:`**:
   - This iterates over each **page** in the PDF document. A PDF consists of a sequence of pages, each potentially containing text, images, and annotations (like form fields).

3. **`if '/Annots' in page:`**:
   - This checks if the current page has any **annotations** (`/Annots`). Annotations include **form fields**, comments, or other interactive elements. If the page has no annotations, it skips to the next page.

4. **`for annotation in page['/Annots']:`**:
   - If there are annotations, this loop iterates over each **annotation object** on the page. These objects represent different elements like form fields (text fields, checkboxes, etc.).

5. **`field = annotation.get_object()`**:
   - This retrieves the actual **annotation object**. PDF annotations are stored as indirect objects in the PDF structure, and `get_object()` allows access to the full content of the annotation.

6. **`field_name = field.get('/T')`**:
   - This line accesses the `/T` key of the annotation, which contains the **name of the form field** (e.g., `"First Name"`, `"Last Name"`). This name is used to identify the field in the PDF structure.

7. **`if field_name:`**:
   - If the field has a name, it proceeds to clean the name and store it in the `fields` dictionary. It strips any parentheses (common in PDF field names).

8. **`fields[field_name] = ""`**:
   - For each form field name found, it adds it to the `fields` dictionary with an empty string as its value. The idea is that this dictionary could later be populated with actual form values.

9. **Return the `fields` dictionary**:
   - Once all pages and annotations have been processed, the function returns a dictionary of all discovered **form field names**. The returned dictionary will have the field names as keys and empty values for each field.

### Example of PDF Structure and Annotations

To understand this better, let’s consider a typical PDF form field structure:

```json
{
  "Pages": [
    {
      "/Annots": [
        {
          "/T": "FirstName",  # Form field name
          "/FT": "/Tx",       # Field type (Tx for text input)
          "/V": ""            # Current value (empty or user-filled)
        },
        {
          "/T": "LastName",
          "/FT": "/Tx",
          "/V": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `/Annots`: Contains a list of annotations (which include form fields) on the page.
- `/T`: Represents the name of the field (like `"FirstName"` or `"LastName"`).
- `/FT`: Represents the **type of form field** (e.g., `/Tx` means it's a text field).
- `/V`: The current **value of the form field** (could be blank or filled).

### How Annotations Work in PDF

- **Annotations** are found on a per-page basis. A page may have multiple annotations, including text fields, checkboxes, or buttons.
- In PDFs, annotations are usually indirect objects. They reference other objects in the PDF (like appearance streams) to describe how they should be displayed or how they behave.
- **/Annots**: This entry in the page dictionary references a list of annotations on the page. Annotations can describe form fields, links, comments, etc.

### Practical Example

Imagine you have a PDF form with three fields:
- `FirstName`: Text input field.
- `LastName`: Text input field.
- `IsHuman`: Checkbox field.

When the code runs, it scans each page and looks for **annotations**. If it finds annotations (form fields), it extracts the **name of each form field** (`/T`) and adds it to the `fields` dictionary. 

**Output** from a PDF with these three fields might look like:
```python
{
    "FirstName": "",
    "LastName": "",
    "IsHuman": ""
}
```

This gives you a map of all the form fields present in the PDF, and in this case, you could later use this to populate the PDF with user data.

### Summary of What the Code Does

- **Iterates over each page** in a PDF to look for **annotations**.
- **Annotations** include form fields like text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
- For each form field (annotation), the code extracts its **name** (`/T`).
- It returns a dictionary containing all form fields found in the PDF, with field names as keys.

This function is the first step in **working with PDF forms**—it identifies the structure of the form fields, allowing for later processing, such as populating or modifying them.
